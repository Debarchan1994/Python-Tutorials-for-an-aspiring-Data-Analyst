HAI,Plain Text,Healthcare-associated infection (HAI): Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (MRSA BSI),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facility_ID,Plain Text,"Facility ID is the primary key used to track facility information for all facilities stored in the Electronic Licensing Management System (ELMS) for California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Center of Healthcare Quality, Licensing and Certification Program. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facility_Name,Plain Text,Facility name for California general acute care hospitals (GACHs) reporting to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) in calendar year 2022.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County,Plain Text,"The name of the California county where the facility is located, derived from COUNTY_CODE in the FACILITY table in ELMS, obtained from the facility's license application form.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hospital_Category_RiskAdjustment,Plain Text,"California general acute care hospitals (GACHs) are categorized into four major categories consistent with the categories NHSN uses for risk adjustment: 1) Acute Care Hospital, 2) Long-Term Acute Care Hospital, 3) Critical Access Hospital, and 4) Rehabilitation Hospital or Unit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hospital_Type,Plain Text,"Specific types of California hospitals are  Major Teaching; Pediatric; Community, >250 Beds; Community, 125-250 Beds; Community, <125 Beds; Long-Term Acute Care (LTAC); Critical Access; Free-Standing Rehabilitation; and Rehabilitation Unit. A major teaching hospital is a hospital that has a teaching program for medical students and a post-graduate medical training program. A pediatric hospital is a hospital with inpatients predominantly age 18 years or younger. A community hospital is a CDPH designation for hospitals not classified as major teaching, long-term acute care (LTAC), critical access, pediatric, or rehabilitation. Community hospitals are further categorized by number of active beds as reported by the hospital in the NHSN Annual Survey. A LTAC hospital is defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as a licensed general acute care hospital providing care for patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days. A critical access hospital is designated by CMS as a hospital with 25 or fewer acute care inpatient beds, located more than 35 miles from another hospital (with some exceptions), with an average length of stay of four days or less. A rehabilitation hospital is an acute care facility exclusively providing evaluation and restoration of function for patients who have lost function due to acute or chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, stroke, or catastrophic events resulting in complete or partial paralysis. A rehabilitation unit is an inpatient ward within a general acute care hospital providing evaluation and restoration of function for patients who have lost function due to acute or chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, stroke, or catastrophic events resulting in complete or partial paralysis. A rehabilitation unit typically has its own unique CMS certification number (CCN) and reports separately from the rest of the hospital. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Infections_Reported,Number,"Count of hospital onset (HO) MRSA BSIs based on a blood specimen collected more than three days after admission to the facility (i.e., on or after day 4), excluding inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) and inpatient psychiatric facilities (IPFs) with their own CCN numbers. A rehabilitation unit (IRF) with its own CCN number reports separately from the rest of the hospital.  The ""NHSN Patient Safety Component Manual"" document contains the specific criteria for an HAI such as MRSA BSI, and provides examples of how to apply the HAI definition; See the NHSN website: http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Infections_Predicted,Number,"The predicted (expected) number of HO MRSA BSI  based on the 2015 national baseline data, adjusting for significant risk factors.  See the Guide to the SIR at the NHSN website: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps-analysis-resources/nhsn-sir-guide.pdf. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient_Days,Number,"A count of the number of patients in the hospital during a time period, excluding  IRFs and IPFs with their own CCN numbers.  A rehabilitation unit (IRF) with its own CCN number reports separately from the rest of the hospital. To calculate patient days, the number of patients is recorded at the same time each day for each day of the month.  At the end of the month, the daily counts are summed.  See the NHSN website: http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SIR,Number,The standardized infection ratio (SIR) is a summary measure used to track HAIs over time. The SIR compares the number of reported HO MRSA BSI to the number of predicted HO MRSA BSI  based on national baseline data. The SIR adjusts for several factors that may impact the risk of acquiring HO MRSA BSI.  NHSN does not calculate a SIR for hospitals with a predicted number of MRSA BSI <1.  CDPH calculated a SIR if the predicted number of infections was <1 and >=0.2; such SIRs and  comparisons are not as precise as SIRs based on a larger number of predicted infections.   NOTE: This 2022 report uses 2015 risk adjustment models and national baseline released by NHSN in 2016.  See the NHSN Guide to the SIR: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps-analysis-resources/nhsn-sir-guide.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SIR_CI_95_Lower_Limit,Number,"Lower limit of the SIR 95% confidence interval calculated using exact Poisson distribution. The confidence interval quantifies the precision of the calculated SIR that is associated with random variation. NOTE:  If the 95% CI for the SIR includes 1, the number of reported infections is not statistically different from that predicted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SIR_CI_95_Upper_Limit,Number,"Upper limit of the SIR 95% confidence interval calculated using exact Poisson distribution. The confidence interval quantifies the precision of the calculated SIR that is associated with random variation. NOTE:  If the 95% CI for the SIR includes 1, the number of reported infections is not statistically different from that predicted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Comparison,Plain Text,"The calculated SIR 95% confidence interval can be used to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number of infections. Based on the SIR 95% confidence interval, we labeled each SIR as indicating: 'Better' (fewer observed infections than predicted), 'Same' (no significant difference in the number of observed and predicted infections), 'Worse' (more observed infections than predicted) . This field is blank if SIRs  the predicted number of infections was <0.2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Met_2020_Goal,Plain Text,"Yes indicates hospital met the 2020 national HAI reduction goal, as recommended by the CDPH HAI Advisory Committee, in calendar year of 2022. From 2015, hospitals should have achieved 50% reduction in MRSA BSI incidence (SIR<0.50).   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Months,Number,"California hospitals are required to report data throughout each calendar year on a quarterly basis.  NHSN data are downloaded in monthly units.  This field indicates the number of months for which a hospital reported ""complete"" data, defined as a numerator (MRSA BSI cases or zero MRSA BSI) and a denominator (facility-wide inpatient days).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SIR_2015,Number,The 2015 standardized infection ratio (SIR) is a summary measure used to track HAIs over time. The SIR compares the number of reported HO MRSA BSI to the number of predicted HO MRSA BSI  based on national baseline data. The SIR adjusts for several factors that may impact the risk of acquiring HO MRSA BSI.  NHSN does not calculate an SIR for hospitals with a predicted number of HO MRSA BSI  <1.  CDPH calculated an SIR if the predicted number of infections was <1 and >=0.2; such SIRs and  comparisons are not as precise as SIRs based on a larger number of predicted infections.   NOTE: This 2022 report uses 2015 risk adjustment models and national baseline released by NHSN in 2016.  See the NHSN Guide to the SIR: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps-analysis-resources/nhsn-sir-guide.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes,Plain Text,"A hospital labeled ""Incomplete Reporter"" is a hospital reporting in-plan MRSA data for fewer months than it was operational. See the Patient Safety Monthly Reporting Plan and Annual Surveys document
(https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/pscmanual/3psc_monthlyreportingplancurrent.pdf) for NHSN's monthly reporting plan definitions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,, ¥ SIR was calculated by CDPH if the predicted number of infections was <1 and >=0.2. The SIR and its comparison are not as precise as SIRs based on a larger number of predicted infections. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
